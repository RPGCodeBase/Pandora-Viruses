    <h2> History and Background </h2>

    <p>
      Gnuplot is a program that has a rich language for the generation of
      plots.  It has a unique place in academia as it was one of the first
      freely available programs for plot generation.  I started using gnuplot
      over 10 years ago while pursuing my Master's degree in Physics and have
      been using it actively ever since.
    </p>

    <h3>Version 0.9 </h3>
    <blockquote>
      My first attempt at a Ruby interface to gnuplot was an object interface
      encapsulating gnuplot language. This was taken directly from the Python
      gnuplot interface. In spite of my being very familiar with Gnuplot and
      Ruby and being the author of the RGnuplot package, I found it
      non-intuitive to use the RGnuplot package.  I found myself constantly
      looking at the code to figure out what I needed to do.

      This was not sufficient and did not sit well.
    </blockquote>

    <h3>Version 1.0</h3>
    <blockquote>
      The second attempt at a Ruby interface was to do absolutely nothing but
      use Ruby's built in string manipulation methods.  This meant that I
      could simply use my knowledge of Gnuplot without having to worry about
      objects.
      
      While in some ways an improvement over Version 0.9, it still did not sit
      well with me.
    </blockquote>

    <h3> Version 2.0 </h3>
    <blockquote>
      After attending RubyConf 2004 I was inspired by Rich Kilmer's use of
      Ruby to implement domain specific languages.  That is the current
      implementation of Gnuplot and quite probably the one that I'll stick
      with for some time.  This version combines the direct mapping of the
      gnuplot language without wrapping with the ruby syntax and mechanism of
      adding methods to existing classes to interface Ruby objects with
      gnuplot.
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Setup </h2>
    
    <h3>Version 2.2</h3>
    
    <p> If the 'gnuplot' command is in your path then there is no required
    setup. If the gnuplot executable for your system is called something other
    than simply 'gnuplot' then set the RB_GNUPLOT environment variable to the
    name of the executable.  This must either be a full path to the gnuplot
    command or an executable filename that exists in your PATH environment
    variable.
    </p>


    <h2> Ruby Gnuplot Concepts </h2>

    <p>
      Gnuplot has a very simple conceptual model.  Calls to <em>Set</em> are
      made to set parameters and either <em>Plot</em> or <em>Splot</em> is
      called to generate the actual plot.  The <em>dataset</em> to be 
      plotted can be specified in a number of ways, contained in a seperate
      file, generated from a function, read from standard input, or read
      immediately after the plot command.
    </p>

    <p>
      The object model for the Ruby gnuplot wrapper directly mimics this
      layout and flow.  The following are the standard steps for generating a
      plot:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
      <li> <p> Instantiate a Plot or Splot object and set parameters by gnuplot
	variable name.</p> </li>

      <li> <p>Instantiate DataSet objects and attach Ruby objects containing
	  the data to be plotted to the DataSet. Attach properties that modify
	  the plot command using the modifier name.</p>
      </li>
      
      <li> <p>Send the Plot/Splot object to a Gnuplot instance for
	  plotting.</p> </li> 
    </ol>

    <p>
      The Version 2.0 interface makes very heavy use of blocks leading to very
      readable code.
    </p>

    <p>Gnuplot.open </p>
    <blockquote>
      Instantiates a new Gnuplot process.  The path to the executable is
      determined on a Unix or MacOSX system using the which command.  Windows
      users, I have no idea what to do.

      If a block is given to the function the opened process is passed into
      the block.  This mimics the most common usage of the File.open method.
    </blockquote>
    
    <p>Plot.new </p>
    <p>SPlot.new </p>
    <blockquote>
      Create a new Plot or Splot object.  DataSets are attached to the object
      to specify the data and its properties. 

      If a block is given to the function, the plot object is passed into the
      block.
    </blockquote>

    <p>DataSet.new</p>
    <blockquote>
      Associates a Ruby object containing the data to plot with the properties
      that will be passed to the plot command for that dataset.  Any Ruby
      object can be associated with a DataSet as long as it understands the
      to_gplot method.
    </blockquote>

    <p> to_gplot </p>
    <blockquote>
      Within Gnuplot, plot data is read in very simple formats.  The
      to_gplot method is expected to write the data of the object in a format
      that is understandable by Gnuplot.  One of the many great things about
      Ruby is that methods can be added after the original declaration.  The
      gnuplot module defines the to_gplot method on the following classes:

      Array, String, and Matrix.

      Simply define a to_gplot method on your own class to tie the class into
      gnuplot.
    </blockquote>

    <h2> Examples </h2>

    <h3> Simple sin wave </h3>

    <p> The following example simply plots the value of sin(x) between the
      ranges of -10 and 10.  A few points to notice:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><p> The code uses nested blocks to construct the plot.  The newly
	  created object is passed to the block so it can be modified in
	  place.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li><p> Each of the gnuplot plot variables are modified using the 
	  variable name as a method name on the plot object or on the dataset
	  object.  The wrapper also takes care of the single quoting that is
	  required on some of the variables like title, ylabel, and xlabel.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li><p> The plot object simply has an array of DataSets.  The
	  constructor initializes this empty array before yielding to the
	  block.  This method uses the &lt;&lt; operator to add the DataSet to
	  the plot.
	</p>
      </li>

      <li><p> When the plot block ends, if an IO object is given to the Plot
	  constructor, the plot commands will be written to the IO object.
	  Any object can be passed to the constructor as long as it
	  understands the &lt;&lt; operator.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <pre class='code'>
Gnuplot.open do |gp|
  Gnuplot::Plot.new( gp ) do |plot|
  
    plot.xrange "[-10:10]"
    plot.title  "Sin Wave Example"
    plot.ylabel "x"
    plot.xlabel "sin(x)"
    
    plot.data << Gnuplot::DataSet.new( "sin(x)" ) do |ds|
      ds.with = "lines"
      ds.linewidth = 4
    end
    
  end
  
end
    </pre>

    <h3> Plotting discrete points </h3>

    <p>
      Array data can be plotted quite easily since Arrays have a defined
      to_gplot method. 
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><p>Simply pass an array of data to the constructor of the DataSet
	  object or set the data property of the DataSet.  In this example,
	  because there are two arrays, each array will be a single column of
	  data to the gnuplot process.
	</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <pre class='code'>
Gnuplot.open do |gp|
  Gnuplot::Plot.new( gp ) do |plot|
  
    plot.title  "Array Plot Example"
    plot.ylabel "x"
    plot.xlabel "x^2"
    
    x = (0..50).collect { |v| v.to_f }
    y = x.collect { |v| v ** 2 }

    plot.data << Gnuplot::DataSet.new( [x, y] ) do |ds|
      ds.with = "linespoints"
      ds.notitle
    end
  end
end
    </pre>

    <h3> Multiple Data Sets </h3>

    <p> As many data sets as are desired can be attached to a plot.  Each of
      these can have their own plot modifiers.  Notice in this example how the
      data array is explicitly set instead of using the &lt;&lt; operator.
    </p>
    
    <p> Also in this example, the commands are not written to the Gnuplot
      process but are instead written to a File called gnuplot.dat.  This file
      can later be run directly by a gnuplot process as it contains only the
      gnuplot commands.
    </p>

    <pre class='code'>
File.open( "gnuplot.dat", "w") do |gp|
  Gnuplot::Plot.new( gp ) do |plot|
  
    plot.xrange "[-10:10]"
    plot.title  "Sin Wave Example"
    plot.ylabel "x"
    plot.xlabel "sin(x)"
    
    x = (0..50).collect { |v| v.to_f }
    y = x.collect { |v| v ** 2 }

    plot.data = [
      Gnuplot::DataSet.new( "sin(x)" ) { |ds|
	ds.with = "lines"
	ds.title = "String function"
	ds.linewidth = 4
      },
    
      Gnuplot::DataSet.new( [x, y] ) { |ds|
	ds.with = "linespoints"
	ds.title = "Array data"
      }
    ]

  end
  
end
    
    </pre>
