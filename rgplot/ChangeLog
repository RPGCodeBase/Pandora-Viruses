Version 2.2  14-Nov-2005

* Formally added the LICENSE.txt file.  It is the new BSD license as defined
  by opensource.org.  See that file for details.

* Added Gnuplot.which to try and fix the recurring problem of windows users
  having to hack code to get things working.

* Added the Gnuplot.gnuplot function so that I can unit test the finding
  gnuplot executable routine.

* In the Array.to_gplot method the terminating e is added to the output.  This
  is in response to Bug #2209.

Version 2.1  17-Nov-2004

* Array.to_gplot and Array.to_gsplot now support passing in arrays of
  arbitrary objects. This is in response to a request by Yoshiki Tsunesada
  (Tracker ID 1063)

Version 2.0   10-Nov-2004

* The 2.0 version of the gnuplot interface is a cross between the original,
  object oriented version, and the version 1.0 which was simply a string
  manipulation library.
